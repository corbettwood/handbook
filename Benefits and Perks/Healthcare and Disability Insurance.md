# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

Popular Pays’ priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our employees good medical, dental, health, vision & life insurance coverage. All of these benefits are managed through Gusto, which every employee should have set up before their first day at Popular Pays. (Currenlty HSA plans are still run through Zenefits). 

For medical, dental, and vision coverage at Popular Pays for employees and their dependents, Popular Pays contributes 75% of the cost for all employee policies and 75% for dependents. The medical plan is with Anthem Blue Cross, the Dental plan is with Assurant Employee Benefits, and the vision plan is with Guardian. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through Gusto, which is where you can find more details about the plans and their coverage.

We will also offer both short term and long term disability insurance, though we are currently waiting to get quotes back from Gusto with our options for coverage.
