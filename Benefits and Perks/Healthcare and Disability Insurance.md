# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

Itâ€™s important to us that we offer our employees good medical, dental, health, vision & life insurance coverage. All of these benefits are managed through Gusto, which every employee should have set up before their first day at Popular Pays. (Currenlty HSA plans are still run through Zenefits). 

For medical, dental, and vision coverage at Popular Pays (for both employees and their dependents), Popular Pays contributes 75% of the cost for all employee policies and 75% for dependents. The medical, vision, and life insurance plans are with  Blue Cross, the Dental plan is with United Health Care. Our HSA plan is directly managed by Zenefits. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through Gusto, which is where you can find more details about the plans and their coverage.

We will also offer both short term and long term disability insurance, though we are currently waiting to get quotes back from Gusto with our options for coverage.
